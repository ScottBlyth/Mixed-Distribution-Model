# MDM - Mixed Distribution Model

## Discrete Distribution

Let there be a distribution of $k$ possibilites. Let there also be $n$ distributions $X_1$, $X_2$,...,$X_n$. Then, a mixed distribution, M, is a linear combination of the distributions:

$$M = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i X_i$$

where $\sum_{i=1}^n p_i = 1$
