# MDM - Mixed Distribution Model

## Discrete Distribution

Let there be a distribution of $k$ possibilites. Let there also be $n$ distributions $X_1$, $X_2$,...,$X_n$. Then, a mixed distribution, M, is a linear combination of the distributions:

$$ M = p_1 X_1 + p_2 X_2 + ... + p_n X_n $$
where $\sum_{i=1}^n p_i = 1$
